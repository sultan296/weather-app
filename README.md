# weather-app

In this Project, I guide you through the process of creating a fully functional weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to enter a city name and retrieves relevant weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. You will see how to structure HTML and style it with CSS for a polished look. I also demonstrate how to connect to a weather API to dynamically fetch and display real-time weather data.
